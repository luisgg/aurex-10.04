Task-Description: Minimal base system
Task-Extended-Description: This task installs the core of an Ubuntu-based system.
Task-Test-new-install: install skip
Task-Seeds: required

Note that some packages that form the core of an Ubuntu-based system are in the required seed, from which this seed inherits. The minimal seed describes those packages at Priority: important.

Recommends are followed when processing this seed even though debootstrap doesn't do that. This may occasionally produce confusing results; however, it should be correct at release time, since the results of processing the seed are synced to Priority: important overrides.
