This seed provides the basic components that should be installed on an
Ubuntu-family desktop system. It is expected to be supplemented with a
particular flavour of desktop environment (e.g. GNOME, KDE, or XFCE).

= Hardware and Architecture Support =

== Architecture-independent ==

 * alsa-base # needed for proper hardware detection (hotplug/blacklist.d, modprobe.d)
 * alsa-utils           # basic audio support and mixer level handling
 * (pcmciautils)        # PCMCIA support for >= 2.6.13-rc1 kernels
 * inputattach          # needed for serial mice

Power management:

 * (acpi-support)
 * (libgl1-mesa-dri) # needed for composite/3D on free graphics drivers
 * (pm-utils-powersave-policy) # lightweight and "safe" subset similar to laptop-mode-tools

Bluetooth:
TODO not for Xubuntu

 * (bluez) # base for bluetooth support
 * (bluez-alsa)
 * (bluez-cups)  # allow connecting to bluetooth printers from CUPS

== armel ==

 * apmd [armel]

== ppc32, ppc64 ==

 * pbbuttonsd [powerpc]

= Console-Based Tools =

These tools are very commonly used by people who drop into a console shell to do some work.

 * bc
 * dc
 * genisoimage
 * (wodim)
 * (cdparanoia)
 * (dvd+rw-tools)
 * screen
 * lftp
 * zip
 * unzip                # also used for .zip support in file-roller
 * libpam-ck-connector  # get ConsoleKit sessions for VTs

= Network Services =

Basic network services and Windows integration.

 * wireless-tools
 * wpasupplicant  # ScottJamesRemnant
 * (libnss-mdns)       # IPv4 link-local DNS support
 * smbclient           # to access files on other SAMBA and Windows servers
 * ca-certificates     # common SSL certificates

These packages help with system integration

 * libsasl2-modules    # allows integration with MTA and login system
 * (avahi-daemon)      # some people do not like it, and it is not essential
 * (plymouth-x11)      # if the desktop is up before we've finished talking to the user at boot time, plymouth needs to display messages in X

= Printing =

Printing and printer configuration is a real weak spot in Debian, and in Linux in general. We will need to stay at the front of the curve here.

 * cups                       # our preferred printer management infrastructure
 * cups-bsd                   # gives us lpc, lpq, lpr, lprm
 * cups-client                # gives us cancel, cupstestppd, lp, lpoptions, lppasswd, lpstat, cupsaddsmb, accept, lpadmin, lpinfo, lpmove
 * foomatic-db-engine           # integrate the foomatic printer driver engine
 * foomatic-db                  # the foomatic printer driver database
 * foomatic-filters             # converter from postscript to printer-specific formats
 * openprinting-ppds            # Most common drivers we want in desktop; less common are in o-p-extra
 * pnm2ppa                      # several ppds require this
 * ghostscript-x
 * (hplip)     			# support for HP all-in-one printers
 * (min12xxw)			# support for KonicaMinolta PagePro 1200W, 1300W printers
 * (foo2zjs)			# support for printing to ZjStream-based printers
 * (splix)			# support for Samsung lasers
 * (pxljr)			# support for HP Color lasers

= GUI infrastructure =

Packages used for X preconfiguration are just Recommends; removing them after initial installation should be relatively safe.

 * (laptop-detect)

 * xorg                          # this includes xserver-xorg->xserver-xorg-{input|video}-* (no need to add specific drivers manually)
 * !linux-image-*                # xorg transitively depends on this, but this would pull in grub-pc; we handle that separately
 * xkb-data                      # XKB data now lives here

Fonts:

 * x-ttcidfont-conf
 * ttf-dejavu-core
 * ttf-freefont
 * (ttf-kacst-one)
 * (ttf-takao-pgothic)
 * (ttf-khmeros-core)
 * (ttf-indic-fonts-core)
 * (ttf-punjabi-fonts)
 * (ttf-thai-tlwg)
 * (ttf-lao)

= Other =

 * anacron # generally appropriate for desktops
 * (bogofilter) # TODO not for Xubuntu
 * libxp6 # required for some third party apps. See #15739
 * ureadahead
 * (kerneloops-daemon) # watch for and allow reporting of kernel problems
 * (policykit-desktop-privileges) # passwordless disk/CPU speed/time operations for admins

= Germinate workarounds =

 * libgl1-mesa-glx # depended upon by freeglut3
