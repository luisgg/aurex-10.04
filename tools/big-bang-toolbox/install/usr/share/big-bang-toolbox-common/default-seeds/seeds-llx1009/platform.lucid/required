This seed describes the packages at Priority: required. These packages are installed by the first pass of debootstrap, which extracts them (dpkg -x, without running maintainer scripts) in order to construct a basic environment into which it can chroot and install them properly.

A system containing only required packages is not a supported Ubuntu system; you need to install at least the packages from minimal as well.

We avoid following Recommends for this seed because it is processed by debootstrap, not apt, and debootstrap only does the minimum necessary.
