space-sunrise
a little plymouth theme to work as "progress bar"
made by Andre "Osku" Schmidt, public domain, or what ever...

to create the needed images, run:
./build.sh

to test it: (assuming you got all setup for testing under x11)
./test.sh
(copies the theme to /usr/share/plymouth/themes/space-sunrise, uses sudo)

the record.sh would try to record the test with recordmydesktop
(starts automatically, press ctrl+shift+s to stop)

code notes
==========

the "offset" variable is used to set the y position of the planet top. 
0 would be center, positive values go down and negative to top of screen.
(all parts should use this offset)

if you scroll past the image/sprite definitions, you see some *.start and
*.end values. those say at which "progress-time" (from 0 to 1) that part
will be faded in. 

sunGlow also has .animStart/End "progress-time", to say when to move from
.startPos to .endPos on the screen
