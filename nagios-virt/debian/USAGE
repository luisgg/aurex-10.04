Installing Nagios configuration using nagios-virt
=================================================

The main program is called /usr/sbin/nagios-virt (or just nagios-virt). To get help online, do:

	nagios-virt --help

It may be helpful to print nagios-virt's configuration, to check that it matches where you think Nagios configuration files, etc. should be installed.

	$ nagios-virt config
	PACKAGE_NAME nagios-virt
	PACKAGE_VERSION version
	NAGIOS_CONFIGDIR /etc/nagios
	NV_DATADIR /usr/share/nagios-virt-version

With Xen
--------
Assuming Xen, you can get nagios-virt to build and test its configuration files for you by doing:

	nagios-virt install

This will generate two files:

	/etc/nagios/virt-library.cfg
	    This is a standard library of (virtualised) services to monitor.
	    Do not edit this file as it will be overwritten each time
            nagios-virt runs. 
	/etc/nagios/virt-hosts.cfg
	    This lists services found on guests on the system. You may edit
            this file, but beware that next time you run nagios-virt install,
            this file will be backed up as virt-hosts.cfg.nvold and a new file
            created in its place. 

Nagios-virt doesn't alter any other configuration files.

Read and follow the instructions that nagios-virt prints out after installation.

With QEMU/KVM
-------------
nagios-virt -c qemu:///system install
